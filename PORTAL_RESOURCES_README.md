All portal resource pages have been successfully implemented! This README provides a quick overview and action items.

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

   - List view with VALUE/QUANT tabs
   - Live stock performance tracking
   - Detail view with embedded PDFs and Excel models
   - Admin interface for managing pitches
   - Mobile-responsive design

2. **Education** (`/portal/dashboard/education`)

   - Uses existing lecture materials

3. **Recruitment** (`/portal/dashboard/recruitment`)
   - Investment Banking (with sub-tabs)
   - Quant resources
   - Financial Modeling guides
   - Download functionality for all files

### Backend Infrastructure

- ✅ Stock performance API with Yahoo Finance integration
- ✅ Pitches CRUD API with admin authentication
- ✅ Supabase database schema (needs to be run)
- ✅ Google Drive sync script (one-time use)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces and types

### Navigation

- ✅ Added to portal sidebar (both desktop and mobile)
- ✅ Proper active states and routing

## 🚀 Required Action Items

### 1. Run Supabase Migration (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST!)

The `pitches` table doesn't exist yet. You must create it:

**Steps:**

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql/new
3. Copy the SQL from: `/docs/SUPABASE_PITCHES_MIGRATION.md`
4. Paste and run the SQL
5. Verify the table was created in Table Editor

**Without this step, the pitches page will not work!**

### 2. Organize Resource Files (IMPORTANT)

You have two options:

**Option A: Use the Sync Script (Automated)**

1. Set up Google Cloud credentials (see `/docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE_SYNC.md`)
2. Run: `npx tsx scripts/sync-drive-resources.ts`
3. Files will be downloaded to `/public/resources/`

**Option B: Manual Upload (Recommended for First Time)**

1. Download files from Google Drive manually
2. Place them in `/public/resources/` following this structure:
   ```
   /public/resources/
   ├── pitches/value/
   ├── pitches/quant/
   ├── education/value/
   ├── education/quant/
   └── recruitment/
       ├── investment-banking/
       ├── quant/
       └── financial-modeling/
   ```

### 3. Add Pitch Data

Once Supabase migration is done:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Go to `/portal/dashboard/pitches/admin`
3. Click "Add Pitch"
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Ticker:** Stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
   - **Team:** VALUE or QUANT
   - **Pitch Date:** When it was pitched
   - **PDF Report Path:** `/resources/pitches/value/AAPL-report.pdf`
   - **Excel Model Path:** `/resources/pitches/value/AAPL-model.xlsx` (VALUE only)
   - **GitHub URL:** Repository link (QUANT only)
5. Save

**File Path Format:** Start with `/resources/` (not `/public/resources/`)

## 📝 Optional Customization

### Update Education Resources

Edit `/src/app/portal/dashboard/education/page.tsx` to add more resources:

```typescript
const educationResources = {
  value: [
    {
      id: 'unique-id',
      title: 'Resource Title',
      path: '/resources/education/value/filename.pdf',
      description: 'Brief description',
    },
    // Add more...
  ],
  quant: [
    // Same structure
  ],
};
```

### Update Recruitment Resources

Edit `/src/app/portal/dashboard/recruitment/page.tsx` similarly.

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in `/docs/`:

- **SUPABASE_PITCHES_MIGRATION.md** - SQL migration and database setup
- **GOOGLE_DRIVE_SYNC.md** - Sync script setup and usage
- **PORTAL_RESOURCES_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete technical implementation details

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

After completing the action items above:

- [ ] Can navigate to `/portal/dashboard/pitches`
- [ ] Can switch between VALUE and QUANT tabs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Table 'pitches' does not exist"

→ You need to run the Supabase migration (Action Item #1)

### "Access denied" on admin page

→ Your user needs `org_permission_level = 'admin'` in Supabase users table

### Stock performance shows "N/A"

→ Either the ticker is invalid, or there's an issue with Yahoo Finance API. Check browser console.

### PDF/Excel not displaying

→ Verify the file path is correct and the file exists in `/public/resources/`

## 🚢 Deployment

Once everything is working locally:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add portal resources pages (Pitches, Education, Recruitment)"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy. Make sure to:

- Commit files in `/public/resources/` so they deploy with the site
- Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
