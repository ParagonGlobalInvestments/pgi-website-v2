# 🎉 Phase 2 Complete: Auth Flow Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **NonMemberBanner Component**

`src/components/notifications/NonMemberBanner.tsx`

A beautiful, animated banner that appears when non-PGI members attempt to sign in:

- **Auto-dismisses** after 10 seconds (configurable)
- **Smooth animations** using Framer Motion
- **Professional design** matching PGI aesthetic
- **Clear CTAs**:
  - "Submit Interest Form" → `/apply#interest-form`
  - "Learn About PGI" → `/apply`
- **Progress bar** shows time until auto-dismiss
- **Manual dismiss** with X button

### 2. **Resources Page Updates**

`src/app/resources/page.tsx`

**New Auth Flow:**

1. **PGI Member (authenticated)**: Shows all internal resources
2. **Non-Member (authenticated)**: Automatically signs them out → redirects to public resources → shows banner
3. **Public (not authenticated)**: Shows public resources with sign-in option

**Key Changes:**

- Checks `/api/users/me` to verify PGI membership
- Auto signs-out non-PGI members
- Shows `NonMemberBanner` when `?notMember=true` param present
- Cleans up URL parameter after showing banner

### 3. **Header Component Updates**

`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Dashboard Button Logic:**

- Now checks **both** authentication AND PGI membership
- Only shows "Dashboard" button if: `user && isPGIMember`
- Otherwise shows "Sign In" button
- Works in both desktop and mobile menus
- Real-time updates when auth state changes

**How It Works:**

- Fetches `/api/users/me` to verify membership
- Caches membership status in state
- Re-checks on auth state changes

### 4. **Sign-In Page Updates**

`src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`

**Non-PGI Member Handling:**

- After OAuth callback, checks `/api/users/me`
- **If PGI member**: Redirects to portal
- **If NOT PGI member**:
  - Immediately signs them out
  - Redirects to `/resources?notMember=true`
  - Banner appears with helpful message

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### **Scenario 1: PGI Member Signs In**

1. User clicks "Member Sign In" on resources page
2. Google OAuth flow
3. User authenticated
4. Backend checks: User exists in Supabase `users` table ✅
5. Redirect to `/portal/dashboard`
6. Header shows "Dashboard" button

### **Scenario 2: Non-PGI Member Attempts Sign In**

1. User clicks "Member Sign In" on resources page
2. Google OAuth flow
3. User authenticated
4. Backend checks: User **NOT** in Supabase `users` table ❌
5. **Immediately sign out user**
6. Redirect to `/resources?notMember=true`
7. **Beautiful banner appears** with message:
   > "You're not currently a member of Paragon Global Investments. Submit your email to our newsletter to stay updated on opportunities, or apply to start your chapter today."
8. Banner auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
9. User sees public resources
10. Newsletter signup form visible
11. Header shows "Sign In" (not "Dashboard")

### **Scenario 3: Public User Browses Resources**

1. User visits `/resources` (not signed in)
2. Sees public resources
3. Sees "PGI Members" and "Stay Updated" cards
4. Can sign in or submit email to newsletter
5. Header shows "Sign In"

## 🛡️ Security & UX Improvements

### **Security:**

- ✅ Non-PGI members **cannot** access dashboard
- ✅ Non-PGI members **cannot** stay authenticated
- ✅ Dashboard button only visible to verified members
- ✅ All checks done server-side via `/api/users/me`
- ✅ Single source of truth: Supabase `users` table

### **User Experience:**

- ✅ Smooth, professional animations
- ✅ Clear messaging (no confusion)
- ✅ Helpful CTAs (interest form, apply page)
- ✅ Non-intrusive banner (auto-dismisses)
- ✅ No "broken" states (immediate sign-out)
- ✅ Consistent PGI design language

## 📊 Current Database State

After Phase 1 migration:

- **241 total users** in Supabase
- **157 active members** from directory (with real emails)
- **84 alumni/inactive** members (graduated)
- **100% of active members** have accurate emails
- **Single source of truth** established ✅

## 🔍 What Gets Checked

### `/api/users/me` Endpoint:

```typescript
// Returns 200 OK if user exists in Supabase users table
// Returns 404 if user authenticated but NOT in users table
```

### Membership Check Flow:

1. User authenticates via Google OAuth
2. Frontend calls `/api/users/me`
3. Backend checks `users` table for `system_supabase_id`
4. **Found**: User is PGI member
5. **Not Found**: User is NOT PGI member

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### NonMemberBanner:

- **Gradient background**: `from-darkNavy to-pgi-dark-blue`
- **Border**: `border-pgi-light-blue/30`
- **Icon**: AlertCircle with PGI light blue
- **Progress bar**: Shows auto-dismiss countdown
- **Animations**:
  - Entry: `y: -50 → 0`
  - Exit: `y: 0 → -50`
  - Spring animation for smooth feel

### Button Styles:

- **Primary CTA**: `bg-pgi-light-blue` with `hover:brightness-110`
- **Secondary CTA**: `bg-white/10` with `hover:bg-white/20`
- **Consistent** with Apply page aesthetic
