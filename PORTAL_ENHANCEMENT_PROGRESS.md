- ‚è≥ Need to add Download All button to rows

## üöß Remaining Work (Phase 2)

### 1. Complete Pitches Page UI

File: `/src/app/portal/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx`

**Needed:**

- Add SearchBar component above the tabs
- Update table headers to be sortable (click to sort)
- Add Exchange badge to each row
- Add "Download All" button to each row
- Update to use filteredValuePitches and filteredQuantPitches

### 2. Update Pitches Detail Page

File: `/src/app/portal/dashboard/pitches/[id]/page.tsx`

**Needed:**

- Add Exchange badge to header
- Add "Download Both Files" button
- Update file paths to use actual paths from database
- Optional: Add performance chart/sparkline
- Optional: Add sector/market cap metadata

### 3. Update Pitches Admin Page

File: `/src/app/portal/dashboard/pitches/admin/page.tsx`

**Needed:**

- Add "Auto-Import Pitches" button that calls import script
- Add Exchange field dropdown (NASDAQ/NYSE)
- Show file existence indicators
- Add preview capabilities
- Better validation

### 4. Run Database Migration

**Manual Step Required:**

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE pitches ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exchange VARCHAR(10);
ALTER TABLE pitches ADD CONSTRAINT check_exchange
  CHECK (exchange IN ('NASDAQ', 'NYSE') OR exchange IS NULL);
```

### 5. Run Import Script

**Manual Step Required:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-pitches.ts
```

This will populate the database with all 10 VALUE pitches from the folder structure.

## üìä Current File Structure Status

**Correct Paths Being Used:**

- `/portal-resources/pitches/value/EXCHANGE_ TICKER - MM.DD.YYYY - xxx_/`
- `/portal-resources/education/value/Value Education - Week X - Class.pdf`
- `/portal-resources/education/quant/Quant Education - Week X - Class.pdf`
- `/portal-resources/recruitment/investment-banking/...`
- `/portal-resources/recruitment/quant/...`
- `/portal-resources/recruitment/financial-modeling/...`

**Total Resources:**

- 10 VALUE pitches (10 PDFs + 10 Excel files)
- 0 QUANT pitches (folder ready for future)
- 4 VALUE education PDFs
- 5 QUANT education PDFs
- 18 Recruitment resources (mix of PDF, Word, Excel)

## üéØ Next Steps to Complete

1. **Finish Pitches Page UI** - Add search bar, sort buttons, exchange badges, download all
2. **Enhance Pitches Detail Page** - Add exchange, download both, better previews
3. **Enhance Pitches Admin Page** - Add auto-import button, exchange field
4. **Run DB Migration** - Add exchange column in Supabase
5. **Run Import Script** - Populate database with pitch data
6. **Test All Pages** - Verify all file paths work, downloads work, mobile responsive
7. **Add Progress Tracking to Education** - Implement checkbox and progress bar

## üêõ Known Issues / Considerations

1. **Pitch Folder Naming** - Some folders end with `xxx_` which is being parsed correctly
2. **Excel Preview** - Using Office Online embed, requires public URL access
3. **Stock Performance** - Yahoo Finance API rate limits handled with 5min cache
4. **Mobile Responsiveness** - All new components built mobile-first
5. **Search Performance** - Using client-side filtering, works well for current data size
